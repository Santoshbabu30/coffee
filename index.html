    <p style="width:50%">Coffee is a beverage prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a
    stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world market for
    hot drinks.[1]
    
    The seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted and
    then ground into fine particles typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It
    is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of
    ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and
    cream are often added to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.
    
    Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The
    earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking as the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in
    the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to
    how it is now prepared for drinking.</p>

    <p style="width:50%">Cold-brewed coffee, or cold brew, is coffee made by steeping ground coffee in room-temperature water for several hours,
    usually 12 to 18 hours or even longer, then straining out the grounds and chilling it before serving it either as-is,
    over ice, or diluted with water.
    
    Cold brewing extracts the flavor along with the caffeine from the coffee beans, producing a rich, flavorful, and
    stimulating brew. As with conventional coffee, milk, cream, and/or sugar are frequent add-ins with cold brew as well.
    
    Cold brew aficionados say that the flavor of cold brew is much smoother and milder and lacking in the acidic quality of
    ordinary brewed coffee. This is because cool water doesn't bring about the chemical changes that produce the acidity as
    well as the bitter flavor associated with hot coffee.

Myanmar. Tea is also made, but rarely, from the leaves of Camellia taliensis.After plain water, tea
is the most widely consumed drink in the worldThere are many different types of tea; some have a cooling, slightly
bitter, and astringent flavour, while others have profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes. Tea
