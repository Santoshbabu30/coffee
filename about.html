    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>In simple terms, tea is a beverage created by infusing hot water with the dried leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant.
    However, tea has a history as rich and diverse as the leaves it's brewed from. Legend has it that tea was first
    discovered when a solitary leaf from the Camellia sinensis plant fortuitously found its way into the cup of a Chinese
    Emperor. Until the 1800s, China exclusively cultivated and manufactured the majority of the world's tea. Throughout
    time, tea cultivation has expanded across regions and is now harvested in 40 different countries, with the most
    significant production stemming from China, Kenya, Sri Lanka, India, and Turkey.
    
    At Art of Tea, our mission is to delve into the world of tea, uncovering its many layers and sharing our discoveries
    with fellow tea enthusiasts.
